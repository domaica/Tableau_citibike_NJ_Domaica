# Tableau_citibike_NJ_Domaica

The requirements of this project asked for visualization and analysis  around the largest bike sharing program in the United States.
Data for program is publicly available and can be foung on the Citi Bike Data webpage:

LINK: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

There are 2 sets of data available. The program has 2 locations in New York and Jersey City
After several downloads, played with data and try and error attempts, I have decided to use for the analysis Jersey City data for the whole year 2019.

Main reason is that for NY I have collected data and after doing proper extraction, cleansing, etc the load files where up to +3 GB of data which made my exercise painful. 

Jersey City datasets are more manageable than NY ones.


## Main technologies used to deploy this project

- 'Python' programming language including 'pandas'package.
- 'Tableau' as visual analytics platform or visualization tool.


## Main folder for solution is called: 'Tableau_citibike_NJ_Domaica'

Inside that root folder, we can find 3 files:

- 'README.md' -> Markdown with project explanation.
- 'citibike_ETL_NJ_2019_v1.ipynb'  notebook file used by Jupyter Notebook with code for Extraction, Transformation and Load to prepare files containing data for the project.
- 'DOMAICA_NJ_citibike_2019_v1.twbx' -> Powerpoint containing screenshots, explaining process and main images of the outcomes, of webpages and additional details.

### - Subfolders 

And 3 additional folders:

- 'instructions'.- Folder containing initial instructions for exercise.
- 'instructions/Images' .- Subfolder with some images used for readme.md explanations.
- 'data2019NJ'.- downloaded zip files with data for analysis
- 'Final_resources_NJ'.- up to 14 .csv files in different subfolders with monthly data. Final file 'FINALALL2019-citibike-NJ.csv' after ETL transformation containing saved data.

## Processing of data & analysis



### 1st Step.- Data processing

#### EXTRACTION
Downloaded 12 csv files from Citi Bike Data webpage for year 2019 and decided to do analysis for Jersey City (New Jersey) instead of New York.
